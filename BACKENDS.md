Configuring backends
--------------------
Backends must be configured through the usage of a configuration file (toml, yaml and json are supported), passed via
`--config-path`.

Documentation is currently provided for `graphite`, `influxdb`, and `newrelic` backends.  For `datadog`, `statsdaemon`, `stdout`,
and `cloudwatch` please refer to the source code.

All configuration is in a stanza named after the backend, and takes simple key value pairs.

Graphite
--------
#### Example with defaults
```
[graphite]
address = "localhost:2003"
dial_timeout = '5s'
write_timeout = '30s'

mode = 'tags'

global_prefix = 'stats'
global_suffix = ''

prefix_counter = 'counters'
prefix_timer = 'timers'
prefix_gauge = 'gauges'
prefix_sets = 'sets'

```

The configuration settings are as follows:
- `address`: the graphite server to send aggregated data to
- `dial_timeout`: the timeout for connecting to the graphite server
- `write_timeout`: the maximum amount of time to try and write before giving up
- `mode`: one of `legacy`, `basic`, or `tags` style naming should be used.  Note that `legacy` and `basic` will
  silently drop all tags.  If there is a need to support tags as Graphite nodes, please raise an issue.

The following 5 options will only be applied if `mode` is `basic` or `tags`.
- `prefix_counter`: the prefix to add to all counters
- `prefix_timer`: the prefix to add to all timers
- `prefix_gauge`: the prefix to add to all gauges
- `prefix_sets`: the prefix to add to all sets
- `gloabl_prefix`: a prefix to add to all metrics

This is always applied
- `global_suffix`: a suffix to add to all metrics

#### Metric names
When `mode` is `basic` or `tags`, the graphite backend will emit metrics with the following naming scheme:

`[global_prefix.][prefix_<type>.]<metricname>[.aggregation_suffix][.global_suffix]`

The `aggregation_suffix` will be `count` or `rate` for counters, and the configured aggregation functions for timers.

When `mode` is `legacy`, the graphite backend will emit metrics with the following scheme:

- counters: `stats_counts.<metricname>[.global_suffix]` (count) and `stats.<metricname>[.global_suffix]` (rate)
- timers: `stats.timers.<metricname>.<aggregation_suffix>[.global_suffix]`
- gauges: `stats.gauges.<metricname>[.global_suffix]`
- sets: `stats.sets.<metricname>[.global_suffix]`


InfluxDB Backend
----------------
The `influxdb` backend supports API versions pre-1.8 (v1) and post-1.8 (v2).  The version to use is selected with the
`api-version` key.  Each version requires different settings to control where data is sent.  The precision is always
seconds.

### Settings
The following settings apply to all versions:
- `api-endpoint`: the API endpoint to use, typically a base address such as `http://influxdb.local`.  The path is
  automatically determined from the `api-version`, so a path should only be present if there is a reverse proxy setup.
  Required with No default.
- `api-version`: the version to use, either `1` or `2`.  Defaults to `2`
- `compress-payload`: specifies whether or not to compress metrics before sending.  Defaults to `true`.
- `credentials`: the credentials to use.  This will be provided via an `Authorization: Token <value>` header.  It is
  not http basic authentication (it is `Token`, not `Basic`), nor does it support JWT with a shared secret.  Please
  raise an issue if this is desired.  Not required, default is no authentication.
- `max-request-elapsed-time`: the maximum amount of time to retry before giving up and dropping data, defaults to `15s`
- `max-requests`: the maximum number of parallel requests.  This is primarily network I/O, with very little CPU, it
  should be capped if it is overwhelming the influxdb server.  Defaults to 10 times the number of logical cores.
- `metrics-per-batch`: the number of metrics to send per request.  InfluxDB recommends 5-10k for 1.x and 5k for 2.x.
  Defaults to `5000`.
- `transport`: the HTTP transport to use, see [TRANSPORT.md](TRANSPORT.md) for further information.

##### Example configuration
```toml
[influxdb]
api-endpoint='https://influxdb.local/'
compress-payload=true
credentials='metrics:metrics'
max-request-elapsed-time='15s'
max-requests=20
metrics-per-batch=7500
transport='default'
```

#### Version 1 specific
- `consistency`: the consistency to send in an enterprise deployment.  Should be `any`, `one`, `quorum`, `all`, or
  unset.  Any other value will show a warning on startup but still use the provided value.  Defaults to unset.
- `database`: the database to send to.  Required, no default.
- `retention-policy`: the retention policy in the database to use.  Not required, default is unset.

##### Example
```toml
[influxdb]
... common settings ...

api-version=1
consistency='any'
database='mydatabase'
retention-policy='myrp'
```


#### Version 2 specific
- `bucket`: the bucket to send to.  Required, no default.
- `org`: the org to send to.  Required, no default.

##### Example
```toml
[influxdb]
... common settings ...

api-version=2
bucket='mydatabase/myrp'
org=''
```

Using v1 settings in v2 or v2 settings in v1 will display a warning on startup and ignore the setting.


### Tag normalization
As the dogstatsd protocol doesn't have exact parity with InfluxDBs line protocol, there is some cleanup applied to the
tags before sending them.  Specifically:
- tags with only a value are normalized as `unnamed:value`
- multiple values for duplicate keys are sorted
- keys with multiple values have their values concatenated with `__`

For example, given the tags `foo, key:bar, unnamed:baz, key:thing, other:something`, the result will be normalized
as `key=bar__thing,other=something,unnamed=baz__foo`.  Tags are also sorted, in accordance with best practices for
efficient ingestion.


### Events
Events are sent as a measurement named `events`.  The tags on the datapoint will be:
- all the tags on the event, excluding the special tag `eventtags` which is ignored
- `host` will be either the source IP address of the event or, if present, the `host` tag
- `priority` will be set to one of `info`, `warning`, `error`, or `success` depending on the priority of the event
- `alerttype` will be set to `normal` or `low` depending on the alert type of the event
- `sourcetypename` will be the source type of the event if present, otherwise there is no `sourcetype` tag

The fields on the datapoint will be:
- `title` is the title of the event
- `text` is the text of the event
- `tags` (specifically a field named `tags`) will be the comma joined list of all tags named `evettags` in the source
  event.

Note: the decisions around tag normalization and events are biased towards querying from Grafana, and were made by a
non-expert in InfluxDB.  As such, they made not match best practices.  Please raise an issue if there are concerns,
including recommendations on how they should be processed and formatted.


## Metrics
Metric names are always what is sent, with the field values carrying the data.  The field names used by each metric
type are as follows:

- counter: `count`, `rate`
- gauge: `value`
- set: `count`
- timer (regular): `lower`, `upper`, `count`, `rate`, `mean`, `median`, `stddev`, `sum`, `sum_squares`, `count_XX`,
  `mean_XX`, `sum_XX`, `sum_squares_XX`, `upper_XX`, `lower_XX`.  These can be configured through the
  `disabled-sub-metrics` setting.
- timer (histogram): `le.+Inf`, `le.XX`

All metric field values are floats, even when they could be integers (such as counts).


New Relic Backend
-----------------
Supports three flush-types for sending metrics to New Relic:
- `infra` Via the Infrastructure Agent's inbuilt HTTP Server (default)
- `insights` Directly to the Insights Collector - [Insights Event API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-events-event-api)
- `metrics` Directly to the Metric API - [Metric Event API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-metric-api)

An attempt will be made to automatically set the `flush-type` based on the address you have configured, [manual configuration](#manual-flush-type-configuration) is also available.

### [New Relic Insights Event API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-events-event-api)
Sending directly to the Event API alleviates the requirement of needing to have the New Relic Infrastructure Agent.
Therefore you can run this from nearly anywhere for maximum flexibility. This also becomes a shorter data path with less
resource requirements becoming a simpler setup.

To use this method, create an Insert API Key from here: https://insights.newrelic.com/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/manage/api_keys.
More information on registering an Insert API Key can be found [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/introduction-event-api#register).

```
#Example Insights Collector configuration

[newrelic]
    transport = "default"
    address = "https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events"
    api-key = "yourEventAPIInsertKey"
```

See [TRANSPORT.md](TRANSPORT.md) for information about `transport`.

> Make sure that `address` is set to `https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events` if your account hosts data in the EU data center.

### [New Relic's Metric API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-metric-api)
To enable sending metrics to the Metric API endpoint you need to set the config setting `address-metrics` to
`https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1`. These events appear in [New Relic Insights](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights)
as a new [event type](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/understanding-insights/new-relic-insights#event-type).
These new events can then be used to leverage the power of [NRQL](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql)
for [querying the metric data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-metric-api#view-and-query).

To use this method, create an Insert API Key from here: https://insights.newrelic.com/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/manage/api_keys

```
#Example Metric API configuration

[newrelic]
    transport = "default"
    address-metrics = "https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1"
    api-key = "yourEventAPIInsertKey"
```

> Make sure that `address-metrics` is set to `https://metric-api.eu.newrelic.com/metric/v1` if your account hosts data in the EU data center.

It is also recommended to set up the backend to either use the [Insight Collector](#new-relic-insights-event-api) or the
[Infrastructure Agent](#new-relic-infrastructure-agent) to send none metric events back to New Relic.

```
#Example Metric API configuration with Insights Collector support

[newrelic]
    transport = "default"
    address = "https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events"
    address-metrics = "https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1"
    api-key = "yourEventAPIInsertKey"
```


### [New Relic Infrastructure Agent](https://newrelic.com/products/infrastructure)
Sending via the Infrastructure Agent's inbuilt HTTP server provides additional features, such as automatically applying
additional metadata to the event the host may have such as AWS tags, instance type, host information, labels etc.

The payload structure required to be accepted by the agent can be viewed [here](https://github.com/newrelic/infra-integrations-sdk/blob/master/docs/v2tov3.md#v2-json-full-sample).

To enable the HTTP server, modify /etc/newrelic.yml to include the below, and restart the agent ([Step 1.2](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/statsd-monitoring-integration#install)).
```
http_server_enabled: true
http_server_host: 127.0.0.1 #(default host)
http_server_port: 8001 #(default port)
```

### Manual Flush Type Configuration
The `flush-type` attribute can be configured with the following available  options - `insights`, `metrics` or `infra`.

```
[newrelic]
    transport = "default"
	flush-type = "insights" # <--
    address = "https://another-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events"
    api-key = "yourEventAPIInsertKey"
```

### Renaming Attributes
This option is only available for `insights` and `infra` flush-types.

Additional options are available to rename attributes if required.
```
[newrelic]
	tag-prefix = ""
	metric-name = "name"
	metric-type = "type"
	per-second = "per_second"
	value = "value"
	timer-min = "min"
	timer-max = "max"
	timer-count = "samples_count"
	timer-mean = "samples_mean"
	timer-median = "samples_median"
	timer-stddev = "samples_std_dev"
	timer-sum = "samples_sum"
	timer-sumsquare = "samples_sum_squares"
```
