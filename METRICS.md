This documents the metrics and tags emitted by gostatsd, their type, tags, and interpretation.

|                              |         |                 | This can be used to tweak receive-batch-size if necessary to reduce memory usage

| channel.min                  | gauge   | channel         | The minimum sample seen

| channel.samples              | gauge   | channel         | The number of samples seen
| internal_dropped             | gauge   |                 | The number of internal metrics which have been dropped in the
|                              |         |                 | lifetime of the process.  Not a counter, because it may not be
|                              |         |                 | submitted.
| heartbeat                    | gauge   | version, commit | The value 1, tagged by the version (git tag) and short commit hash
| flusher.total_time           | gauge   |                 | Time taken to flush all metrics to all backends for the flush interval
| backend.created              | gauge   | backend         | Lifetime number of metric batches generated by the backend
| backend.retried              | gauge   | backend         | Lifetime number of metric batches retried by the backend
| backend.dropped              | gauge   | backend         | Lifetime number of metric batches dropped by the backend (DATALOSS!)
| backend.sent                 | gauge   | backend         | Lifetime number of metric batches successfully transmitted



| Tag           | Description
| ------------- | -----------
| aggregator_id | The index of an aggregator, the amount corresponds to the --max-workers flag
| channel       | The name of an internal channel
| version       | The git tag of the build
| commit        | The short git commit of the build
| backend       | The backend sending a particular metric


A number of channels are tracked internally, they emit metrics under the channels.* space.  They will all have a
channel tag, and may have additional tags specified below.  Channels are sampled at a regular interval. **After** a
flush, basic stats are sent about the data sampled - that is, internal metrics lag regular metrics by a flush
interval.

| Channel name              | Additional tags | Description
| ------------------------- | --------------- | -----------
| dispatch_aggregator       | aggregator_id   | Channel to dispatch metrics to a specific aggregator.
| backend_events_sem        |                 | Semaphore limiting the number of events in flight at once.  Corresponds to
|                           |                 | the `--max-concurrent-events` flag.



- If both --internal-namespace and --namespace are specified, and metrics are dispatched internally, the resulting
  metric will be namespace.internal_namespace.metric.
