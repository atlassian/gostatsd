This documents the metrics and tags emitted by gostatsd, their type, tags, and interpretation.  All internal metrics are
snapshot after a flush, then queued internally for sending in the next flush.  Specifically this means that internal
metrics will lag regular metrics by one flush interval.  See below for notes on how channels are monitored.

Metric types:

| type               | description
| ------------------ | -----------
| gauge (flush)      | A value sent as a gauge with the value reset / calculated / sampled every flush interval
| gauge (time)       | A single duration measured in milliseconds and sent as a gauge
| gauge (cumulative) | An internal counter sent as a gauge with the value never resetting
| gauge (sparse)     | The same as a cumulative gauge, but data is only sent on change
| counter            | An internal counter, reset on flush

| failure       | The reason a batch of metrics was not processed
| server-name   | The name of an http-server as specified in the config file

A number of channels are tracked internally, they emit metrics under the channel.* space.  They will all have a
channel tag, and may have additional tags specified below.  Channels are sampled at a regular interval. After a
flush, basic stats are sent about the data sampled (internal metrics lag regular metrics by a flush interval) and
the samples are reset.

| Channel name              | Additional tags | Description
| ------------------------- | --------------- | -----------
| dispatch_aggregator_map   | aggregator_id   | Channel to dispatch metric maps to a given aggregator.
| backend_events_sem        |                 | Semaphore limiting the number of events in flight at once.  Corresponds to
|                           |                 | the `--max-concurrent-events` flag.



- If both --internal-namespace and --namespace are specified, and metrics are dispatched internally, the resulting
  metric will be namespace.internal_namespace.metric.
