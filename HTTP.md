## HTTP endpoints

### `prof` endpoints
- `/trace`, runs a trace profile for 30 seconds
- `/pprof`, runs a pprof profile for 30 seconds
- `/memprof`, runs a `heap` memory profile for 30 seconds

Only one prof will be allowed to run at any point, and requesting multiple will block until the previous has completed.

### `expvar` endpoints
- `/expvar`, routes directly to the [expvar handler](https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/#Handler)

### `healthcheck` endpoints
- `/healthcheck`, reports if the server is internally healthy.  This is what should be used for health checking by an LB.
- `/deepcheck`, reports the status of downstream services.  This should not be used for system healthcheck, as a bad
  dependency should not cause an otherwise healthy server to cycle, because it will likely fail again.

### `ingestion` endpoint
- `/vN/raw` and `/vN/event`, takes in protobuf formatted raw metrics.  This endpoint is intended for gostatsd to
  gostatsd communication only, and thus not documented. This is to deter a service which may not bother to consolidate
  metrics, which would be detrimental to the health of the aggregation service. The version spoken by a forwarding
  instance is not configurable.

  The compatibility guarantee is:
  - A bump of N will be a major bump of the service version
  - A bump of N will retain support for N-1, dropping N-2 if present.
  - A major bump of the service version may not increase N.
  - A major bump of the service version may drop N-1 support without adding N+1.
  - There will never be more than N-1 and N.

  All changes of N will be documented in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).  N is currently 2.
